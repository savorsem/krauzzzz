# Project Report: SalesPro Spartans

## 1. Critical Fixes
- **NPM Package Resolution**: Fixed build failure by updating `@google/genai` version from `^0.1.1` to `^0.2.0` in `package.json`. The previous version was not found in the registry.
- **Service Worker Optimization**: Removed `index.tsx` from the cache list in `service-worker.js`. Since the app is built with Vite, source files should not be cached. Added logic to better handle external API requests (skipping cache for Google/Supabase).

## 2. Code Quality & Safety
- **Gemini Service**:
  - Added optional chaining and null checks when accessing `response.candidates` in `generateSpartanAvatar` to prevent runtime crashes if the AI model returns empty candidates (e.g., due to safety filters).
  - Verified `GenerateContentResponse` usage aligns with the text property accessor pattern (`response.text`).
  - Corrected imports and type usage for the new `@google/genai` SDK.

## 3. Improvements
- **Profile Component**: Updated in the previous step (user request) to include Armor and Background style selection.
- **Type Safety**: Ensured `ReactPlayer` usage doesn't conflict with TypeScript in strict mode.

## 4. Recommendations
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `API_KEY` (Gemini) and `SUPABASE_URL`/`KEY` are correctly set in the Vercel deployment settings.
- **Database**: Run the SQL script provided in the Admin Dashboard -> Database tab to initialize the Supabase schema.
- **Monitoring**: The `SystemHealthAgent` is configured to auto-recover from storage quota errors. Monitor logs in the Admin Dashboard if users report data loss.

## 5. Deployment
- The project is ready for deployment. The `vercel.json` and updated `package.json` ensure a smooth build process on Vercel.
